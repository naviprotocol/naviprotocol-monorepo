The liquidation mechanism module provides liquidation functionality. When a borrower's health factor falls below the liquidation threshold, liquidators can repay the borrower's debt in exchange for their collateral.

## Core Concepts

### Liquidation Principle

The liquidation mechanism is an important security mechanism in lending protocols:

1. **Trigger Condition**: When a borrower's health factor falls below the liquidation threshold
2. **Liquidator**: Anyone can become a liquidator
3. **Liquidation Process**: Liquidators repay debt and receive collateral
4. **Liquidation Reward**: Liquidators receive liquidation rewards as incentives

### Liquidation Process

1. **Monitoring**: Monitor the borrower's health factor
2. **Trigger**: Trigger liquidation when health factor falls below threshold
3. **Execution**: Liquidators execute liquidation transactions
4. **Settlement**: Liquidators receive collateral and rewards
