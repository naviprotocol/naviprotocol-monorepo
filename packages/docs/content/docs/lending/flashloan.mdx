title: Flash Loan
---

The Flash Loan module provides uncollateralized borrowing functionality, allowing users to borrow and repay assets in the same transaction, primarily used for arbitrage, debt restructuring, and other scenarios.

## Core Concepts

### Flash Loan Principle

Flash loans allow users to borrow assets without collateral, but must meet the following conditions:

1. **Same Transaction**: Borrowing and repayment must be completed in the same transaction
2. **Complete Repayment**: Must repay the full borrowed amount plus fees
3. **Atomicity**: If repayment fails, the entire transaction will be rolled back

### Use Cases

- **Arbitrage Trading**: Price arbitrage between different DEXs
- **Debt Restructuring**: Optimize borrowing portfolios to reduce interest rates
- **Liquidation Protection**: Quickly replenish collateral to avoid liquidation
- **Liquidity Management**: Temporarily obtain liquidity for other operations
