title: Flash Loan
---

The Flash Loan module provides uncollateralized borrowing functionality, allowing users to borrow and repay assets in the same transaction, primarily used for arbitrage, debt restructuring, and other scenarios.

## Core Concepts

### Flash Loan Principle

Flash loans allow users to borrow assets without collateral, but must meet the following conditions:

1. **Same Transaction**: Borrowing and repayment must be completed in the same transaction
2. **Complete Repayment**: Must repay the full borrowed amount plus fees
3. **Atomicity**: If repayment fails, the entire transaction will be rolled back

### Use Cases

- **Arbitrage Trading**: Price arbitrage between different DEXs
- **Debt Restructuring**: Optimize borrowing portfolios to reduce interest rates
- **Liquidation Protection**: Quickly replenish collateral to avoid liquidation
- **Liquidity Management**: Temporarily obtain liquidity for other operations

## API Reference

### getAllFlashLoanAssets

Get all available flash loan assets from the API. Uses caching to avoid repeated API calls. See [documentation](/typedoc/variables/_naviprotocol_lending.getAllFlashLoanAssets.html) for details.

**Usage Example**

```typescript
import { getAllFlashLoanAssets } from '@naviprotocol/lending'

const flashLoanAssets = await getAllFlashLoanAssets({
  env: 'prod',
  cacheTime: 30000
})
```

**Result Example**

```json
[
  {
    "max": "50000000000",
    "min": "0",
    "assetId": 3,
    "poolId": "0x71b9f6e822c48ce827bceadce82201d6a7559f7b0350ed1daa1dc2ba3ac41b56",
    "supplierFee": 0,
    "flashloanFee": 0.0006,
    "coinType": "0xaf8cd5edc19c4512f4259f0bee101a40d41ebed738ade5874359610ef8eeced5::coin::COIN"
  }
]
```

### getFlashLoanAsset

Get a specific flash loan asset by identifier. See [documentation](/typedoc/functions/_naviprotocol_lending.getFlashLoanAsset.html) for details.

**Usage Example**

```typescript
import { getFlashLoanAsset, getPool } from '@naviprotocol/lending'

// Get by coin type
const assetByCoinType = await getFlashLoanAsset('0x2::sui::SUI')

// Get by asset ID
const assetById = await getFlashLoanAsset(0)

// Get by pool
const pool = await getPool('0x2::sui::SUI')
const assetByObject = await getFlashLoanAsset(pool)
```

**Result Example**

```json
{
  "max": "5000000000",
  "min": "0",
  "assetId": 0,
  "poolId": "0x96df0fce3c471489f4debaaa762cf960b3d97820bd1f3f025ff8190730e958c5",
  "supplierFee": 0,
  "flashloanFee": 0.0006,
  "coinType": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002::sui::SUI"
}
```

### flashloanPTB

Create a flash loan transaction in the PTB (Programmable Transaction Block). This function initiates a flash loan by borrowing the specified amount of assets. The borrowed assets must be repaid within the same transaction using `repayFlashLoanPTB`. See [documentation](/typedoc/functions/_naviprotocol_lending.flashloanPTB.html) for details.

**Usage Example**

```typescript
import { flashloanPTB } from '@naviprotocol/lending'
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions'

const tx = new Transaction()

const [balance, receipt] = await flashloanPTB(
  tx,
  '0x2::sui::SUI', // Asset identifier
  1000000000, // Amount to borrow
  { env: 'prod' }
)
```

### repayFlashLoanPTB

Repay a flash loan transaction in the PTB. This function repays the flash loan using the receipt from the original flash loan and the coin object containing the repayment amount. See [documentation](/typedoc/functions/_naviprotocol_lending.repayFlashLoanPTB.html) for details.

**Usage Example**

```typescript
import { repayFlashLoanPTB } from '@naviprotocol/lending'
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions'

const tx = new Transaction()

const [balance] = await repayFlashLoanPTB(
  tx,
  '0x2::sui::SUI', // Asset identifier
  receipt, // Receipt from original flash loan
  coinObject, // Coin object containing repayment amount
  { env: 'prod' }
)
```

## Complete Flash Loan Example

Here's a complete example of how to use flash loans for arbitrage:

```typescript
import { flashloanPTB, repayFlashLoanPTB } from '@naviprotocol/lending'
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui/transactions'

async function executeFlashLoanArbitrage() {
  const tx = new Transaction()

  // Step 1: Initiate flash loan
  const [borrowedBalance, receipt] = await flashloanPTB(
    tx,
    '0x2::sui::SUI',
    1000000000, // 1 SUI
    { env: 'prod' }
  )

  // Step 2: Execute arbitrage logic with borrowed funds
  // ... your arbitrage trading logic here ...

  // Step 3: Repay the flash loan
  const [remainingBalance] = await repayFlashLoanPTB(
    tx,
    '0x2::sui::SUI',
    receipt,
    borrowedBalance,
    { env: 'prod' }
  )

  // Step 4: Execute the transaction
  ...
}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Transaction Atomicity**: Flash loans must be completed within a single transaction. If any part fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

2. **Fee Calculation**: Flash loans incur fees that must be included in the repayment amount.

3. **Pool Support**: Not all pools support flash loans. Always check if the pool supports flash loans before attempting to use them.

4. **Amount Limits**: Each asset has a maximum flash loan amount. Exceeding this limit will cause the transaction to fail.
