title: Bridge Migration
---

This guide will help you migrate bridge-related features from the old navi-sdk to the new @naviprotocol/astros-bridge-sdk package.

The new package separates bridge-related features from the original navi-sdk. Since the interface definitions remain unchanged, you can quickly migrate to the new version with only minor adjustments.

## Install New Package

First, uninstall the old package and install the new one:

```npm
npm uninstall navi-sdk
npm install @naviprotocol/astros-bridge-sdk
```

## Interface Migration

**Old Version:**

```typescript
import {Bridge} from 'navi-sdk'

```

**New Version:**

```typescript
import * as Bridge from '@naviprotocol/astros-bridge-sdk'

```
